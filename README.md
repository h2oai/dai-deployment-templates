# Driverless AI Deployment Templates

This repository contains different deployment templates for Driverless AI (DAI) scorers.

The structure is as follows:
* `common`: Code shared by multiple deployment templates
  * `swagger`: The shared REST API definitions. Please don't duplicate.
  * `rest-{framework}-model/api`: Modules with Java classes autogenerated from the API Swagger definition.
  * `transform`: Shared transformers between mojo and API classes.
* `{target}-scorer`: One module per deployment target.


## Build

This is a Gradle multi-project repository.
To get the resulting distribution archive, run:

```bash
$ ./gradlew distributionZip
```

The result of which is `./build/dai-deployment-templates-{CURRENT_VERSION}.zip`, which is in turn integrated in
the DAI build and deployment process.

Note that each of the templates is expected to inject its files in this archive in their respective gradle files.
Please see and follow examples in the existing deployment templates.
