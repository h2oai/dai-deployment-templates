# Driverless AI Model Deployment: Apache Hive

Driverless AI models can be deployed in Hive with HiveQL (HQL). Using Driverless AI and Hive together lets you quickly build and deploy models. 

The following User-Defined Function (UDF) lets the model name be used as part of the query, which means that a single UDF can dynamically load and score multiple models.

This UDF have been tested with both Hive and Beeline shells.

## Hive UDF Scorer Download

Download the Hive scorer from the [Custom Scorers download page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.h2o.ai/releases/ai/h2o/dai-custom-scorers/DAI-1.8.9/index.html).

## Deployment

Run the following in the Hive console.

**Note**: Use the runtime that matches the Driverless AI version the model was created with.

```
hive> add jar mojo2-runtime-1.5.5.jar;  
Added [mojo2-runtime-1.5.5.jar] to class path  
Added resources: [mojo2-runtime-1.5.5.jar]  

hive> add jar DAIMojoRunner_Hive.jar;  
Added [DAIMojoRunner_Hive.jar] to class path  
Added resources: [DAIMojoRunner_Hive.jar]  

hive> list jar;  
mojo2-runtime-1.5.5.jar  
DAIMojoRunner_Hive.jar  

hive> create temporary function daiPredict as 'daimojorunner_hive.daiPredict';  

hive> set DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_FILE=license.sig;  
hive> select id, daiPredict(loan_amnt, term, int_rate, installment, emp_length, home_ownership, annual_inc, verification_status, addr_state, dti, delinq_2yrs, inq_last_6mths, pub_rec, revol_bal, revol_util, total_acc) from lcdata where addr_state='CA' and loan_amnt>34000;  
1068159	"bad_loan.0"='0.7421794315246639', "bad_loan.1"='0.2578205684753361â€™

hive> describe function extended daiPredict;  
Call a Driverless AI Mojo for scoring prediction  
Synonyms: daipredict  
```

### Variables:  
- ```DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_FILE```: Path to license file 
- ```DRIVERLESS_AI_MODEL_NAME```: Overrides mojo name (default: pipeline.mojo)  
- ```DRIVERLESS_AI_MODEL_OUTPUT_LABELS``` (true | false): Specify whether to output target labels (default: true)  
    Example: select daiPredict(col1, col2). 


## Environment Variables
The Hive UDF uses environment variables to pass the Driverless AI license and model name. It also uses an environment variable to specify whether feature labels are included as part of the output.
